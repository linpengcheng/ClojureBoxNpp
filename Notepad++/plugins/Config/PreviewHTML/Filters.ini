[--- Information ---]
This SAMPLE file contains the filters to be run before previewing a file in Notepad++.
Save this file as 'filters.ini' (instead of 'filters.sample.ini') to see it in action.

Each section below defines a custom filter.

The preview plugin decides whether or not to run each filter based on the file's extension OR the
active highlighter language.  The first filter encountered is run, any other matching filters are
ignored.

Any filter can be disabled by commenting it out, or by starting the name with a '-' hyphen; 
for example [-PHP] instead of [PHP].
